Scheduler Priority Levels
	SCHEDULER		/* always gets first priority */
	KERNEL
	USER			/* IO directly under control of the user */
	IO				/* other IO */
	REAL_TIME
	APPLICATION
	MAINTENANCE
	IDLE

Policy goals
	no process left idle for too long
	minimize CPU idle time <=> maximize throughput
	minimize user response time
	allow processes to prioritize children

True real-time performance is only possible with special builds
